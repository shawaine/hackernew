# Hackernews clone

this project is based on https://www.howtographql.com then I edited and use some hooks in reactjs

## Tech Stack

React.js and Apollo for front-end
&nbsp;
Node.js and GraphQL for back-end

- Install node js on your machine
- cd to client directory (i.g. cd client), type "npm install" for client dependencies
- cd to root directory, type "npm install" for server dependencies
- type "npm run dev" to start the server
- Go to http://localhost:4000 for server
- Go to http://localhost:3000 for client
